## üì¶ Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

-   PHP >= 8.2
-   Composer
-   Node.js & npm (or Yarn)
-   MySQL (or another database supported by Laravel)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/delinquent-id.git
    cd delinquent-id
    ```

2.  **Install PHP dependencies:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Copy the environment file:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5.  **Generate application key:**

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6.  **Configure your database:**
    Open the `.env` file and update the database credentials:

    ```dotenv
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=delinquent_id
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=gualupa420
    ```

7.  **Run database migrations and seeders:**

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```

    This command will set up the database schema and populate it with initial data, including roles, permissions, and a default admin user. The seeders are idempotent, meaning you can run this command again without causing errors or data duplication.

8.  **Link storage:**

    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

9.  **Compile assets:**

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    For production, use `npm run build`.

10. **Start the development server:**

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## üí° Default Users

The database seeder creates the following users for testing and administration:

-   **Admin:**
    -   **Email:** `admin@example.com`
    -   **Password:** `admin123`
-   **Test User:**
    -   **Email:** `test@example.com`
    -   **Password:** `password`

You can access the Filament admin panel at `/admin` using the admin credentials.
