## üì¶ Installation

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

*   PHP >= 8.2
*   Composer
*   Node.js & npm (or Yarn)
*   MySQL (or another database supported by Laravel)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/delinquent-id.git
    cd delinquent-id
    ```

2.  **Install PHP dependencies:**
    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install Node.js dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    yarn install
    ```

4.  **Copy the environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

5.  **Generate application key:**
    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

6.  **Configure your database:**
    Open the `.env` file and update the database credentials:
    ```dotenv
    DB_CONNECTION=mysql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=3306
    DB_DATABASE=delinquent_id
    DB_USERNAME=root
    DB_PASSWORD=
    ```

7.  **Run database migrations and seeders:**
    ```bash
    php artisan migrate --seed
    ```
    This will create the necessary tables and populate them with some initial data (including a default admin user).

8.  **Link storage (if not already linked):**
    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

9.  **Compile assets:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # OR
    yarn dev
    ```
    For production, use `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

10. **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.
